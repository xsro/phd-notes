  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we consider a multi-agent consensus problem with an active leader and variable interconnection topology. The state of the considered leader not only keeps changing but also may not be measured. To track such a leader, a neighbor-based local controller together with a neighbor-based state-estimation rule is given for each autonomous agent. Then we prove that, with the proposed control scheme, each agent can follow the leader if the (acceleration) input of the active leader is known, and the tracking error is estimated if the input of the leader is unknown.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this article, we investigate a moving-target-fencing problem for multiple vehicles using nearest neighbor rules where the target moves with an unknown constant velocity. Without a predefined stand-off distance or formation, two local cooperative controllers are proposed using only the relative position information from the target and its neighbors within its local frame of reference. The controllers consist of three functionalities. The repulsive term between a vehicle and its neighbors is used to avoid collision. The attractive term between a vehicle and the target drives the vehicle toward the target. The adaptive term amounts to estimate the target's velocity. Specifically, with the first controller, the vehicles follow the target's velocity in the average sense resulting in rotation about the target; with the second controller, each vehicle is able to follow the target's velocity resulting in a rigid formation. Furthermore, a decentralized estimator is applied to handle the case where only a portion of vehicles can access the target's position. Both controllers assure target fencing. The results are proved by rigorous theoretical analysis and verified by extensive numerical simulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {This article studies the moving-target-fencing problem of multiple second-order vehicles, where the target moves with an unknown constant velocity. Without a predefined stand-off distance or formation, two classes of local cooperative controllers are proposed with and without velocity measurements. Specifically, the first controller uses the relative position information from the target and vehicle's neighbors, as well as the vehicle's velocity measurement, while the second controller relaxes the common requirement of velocity measurement of the vehicles. It is proved that both controllers simultaneously assure target fencing, collision avoidance, and velocity convergence. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify the efficacy of the proposed controllers.},
